subtitle: \'Going to the mountains is going home\' - John Muir

Well, the world is full of fun things, or at least many that I find fun. However, it's a bit hard to capture the feeling of a deep conversation with old friends, or of the moment of discovery of some facinating new facet of astronomy, or of sending a rock climb you've been projecting for a while. 

But, I love the mountains more than I know what to do with, and have a decent camera. Nobody's ever accused me of bing a skilled photographer, but I'll admit that I'm pretty darned good at going to beautiful places. So here's a little rest for the eyes. 

** Beautiful pictures go here when I get around to it **
