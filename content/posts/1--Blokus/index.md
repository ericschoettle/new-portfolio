Blokus is exactly my kind of board game: minutes to explain, months to master. It's also my kind of coding project: visual-spatial, heavy in logic, highly amenable to component reuse. So, I built a blokus clone (please don't sue me, I make it out of love and respect for the game!) to learn React, and a very simple AI so you can play the game even without friends. [Check it out!](Chttps://ericschoettle.github.io/React-Blokus/)

I hope to expand the project by adding some basic strategies and a little stochastic behavior to the AI, and by using websockets to build a true multiplayer experience.
